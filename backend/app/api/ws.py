"""WebSocket endpoint and broadcaster (SPEC.md section 6.11).

On connect: a snapshot, then a stream of metric/alert/incident_update/logs/
heartbeat messages.

Each client gets its own bounded outbound queue drained by its own sender
task, so ``broadcast()`` never awaits a network write: one slow or stalled
browser can't slow detection down. The snapshot is queued *before* the client
joins the broadcast set, so it is always the first message a client sees and
can't interleave with a live message. A client that falls more than
``CLIENT_QUEUE_SIZE`` messages behind is disconnected rather than silently
skipped; its reconnect fetches a fresh snapshot, so it never shows a state
with holes in it.
