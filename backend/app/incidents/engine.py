"""Incident lifecycle: dedup, escalation, cooldown, auto-resolve, MTTR
(SPEC.md section 6.8).

Two independent sources drive a fingerprint's lifecycle:

- ``record_alert()``: a new Alert for some anomaly. Deduplicated by
  fingerprint — attached to any existing OPEN/ACKNOWLEDGED incident (bumping
  ``alert_count`` and ``peak_severity``), or opens a new one.
- ``record_normal_window()`` / ``sweep_hipaa_timeouts()``: the *absence* of
  further anomalies, which is what lets a service incident auto-resolve
  after 6 consecutive normal windows, and a HIPAA incident auto-resolve
  after 10 minutes with no new matching alert.

Fingerprint: ``(kind, service)`` for service anomalies, ``(kind, user_id)``
for HIPAA anomalies — SPEC.md's rule exactly.

``IncidentUpdate.should_notify`` is only ever a hint for the AWS notifier
(Milestone 5) about whether to push a message out. Storage and the
WebSocket broadcast are unconditional: SPEC.md 6.8 says "every state change
is written to the incident_events table and broadcast over WebSocket",
full stop — cooldown only suppresses the *external* notification.
